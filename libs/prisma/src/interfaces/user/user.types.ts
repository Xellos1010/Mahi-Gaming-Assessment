import { Book, User } from "@prisma/client";

//Prisma uses a highly dynamic type system, and the User type doesn't automatically include relations unless explicitly configured with include in the query. TypeScript sees User as the base model and doesnâ€™t account for additional properties like favoriteBooks.
//Explicitly defining a type that includes the relation favoriteBooks to use in my interface
export interface PrismaUserResponseWithFavoriteBooks extends User {
    favoriteBooks: Book[];
